# LW1949 1.0.0.9004

* Constrained corrected values for observed effects of 0% to a maximum of 10.5% and those for observed effects of 100% to a minimum of 89.5% in keeping with the intended application of Litchfield and Wilcoxon's (1949) Table 1.
* Incorporated rounding in keeping with the true approach taken by Litchfield and Wilcoxon (1949)
    * `fitlinear()` - default setting for argument `constr` set to `c(0.0005, 0.9995)`
    * `assessfit()` - exclude records with expected effects < 0.005% or > 99.995%
    * `correctval()` - apply corrected values to expected effects < 0.5% or > 99.5%
    * `LWestimate()` - calculate `Nprime` as number of observations between ED15.5% and ED84.5%
* Introduced greater flexibility in plotting functions.
    * `plotDELP()` - added argument `grid`
    * `LWnomo1()` - added argument `...`
* Extended `predLines()` and `predLinesLP()` to cover entire x-range
