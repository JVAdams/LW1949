\title{Litchfield and Wilcoxon's Chi-Squared Statistic}
\usage{
LWchi2(obsn, expn, totn)
}
\arguments{
\item{obsn}{A numeric vector of observed counts.}

\item{expn}{A numeric vector of expected counts.}

\item{totn}{A numeric vector of total counts possible.}
}
\value{
A list of length two.
  The first element is a numeric vector of length three:
    \code{chistat}, chi-squared statistic;
    \code{df}, degrees of freedom; and
    \code{pval}, P value.
  The second element is a numeric vector the same length as \code{obsn},
    contributions to the chi-squared.
}
\description{
Calculate the chi-squared statistic from observed and expected counts
using the Litchfield and Wilcoxon (1949) approach.
}
\details{
The denominator of Litchfield and Wilcoxon's (1949) chi-squared estimate
  is the minimum of the \code{expn} and (\code{totn} - \code{expn})
  following their Nomograph No. 1.
