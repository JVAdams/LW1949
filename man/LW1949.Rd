\title{Automated Litchfield and Wilcoxon (1949) Evaluation of Dose-Effect
Experiments}
\description{
\pkg{LW1949} is an automated approach to Litchfield and Wilcoxon's (1949)
evaluation of dose-effect experiments.
\pkg{LW1949} was first introduced by Adams et al. (\emph{in preparation}).
}
\details{
An example of how to use the functions in \pkg{LW1949} is given in this
vignette
\href{https://rawgit.com/JVAdams/LW1949/master/vignettes/Intro.html}{[link]}.
Use \code{\link{dataprep}} to create a data frame with the results of a
dose-effect experiment.
Use \code{\link{fitLWauto}} and \code{\link{LWestimate}} to 
  fit dose-effect relations.
And use \code{\link{plotDELP}} and \code{\link{plotDE}} to plot the results.
